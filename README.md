compare observed seismic ridges to synthetic frequency spectra computed with MESA/GYRE 


simple script for comparing observational to synthetic frequency spectra 

Example: ridges for alpha Centauri A

functions:
   located in slider_MESA_module.py
   
run script:
    example_script.py
  
loads the data files:
  synthetic: "MESA_output.gyre"
  observed: "deMeulenaer_observed_acenA.dat"
